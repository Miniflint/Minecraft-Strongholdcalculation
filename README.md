# Minecraft-Strongholdcalculation
Get the stronghold coordinate with only 2 enderpearl

how it works :
it find the intersection between the 2 straight line of the enderpearl and give you the coordinate

# Step 1 :
*(include the coordinate after the point for a better accuracy) (3.141)*

enter coordinate X before launching the first enderpearl 
enter coordinate Z before launching the first enderpearl

# Step 2 :
*lauch the enderpearl, and go under it*

enter coordinate X after launching the first enderpearl 
enter coordinate Z after launching the first enderpearl

# Step 3 :

Repeat for the second enderpearl, the farther you go, the more accurate the coordinate will be, I recommend going around 200 bloc from the first enderpearl
